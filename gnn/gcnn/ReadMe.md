This is a simple implement for GCNN. You can check the paraper at papaer&annotation folder.
<br>
ProgramAnnotation is the annotation writed for this program. It includes two parts:
<br>
First is the analysis for a GAT program https://github.com/Diego999/pyGAT because I learned a lot from it.
<br>
Second is GCNN. Just run models.py and the example will go on.
<br>
I only rewrite the GCNN model part and other codes are copied from the repo mentioned above. This model is also simplified because I didn't consider the distance-weighted matrix W.
